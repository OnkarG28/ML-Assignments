## Overview

Machine learning is a critical skill in the fields of data analytics and data science. This repository includes a series of assignments designed to introduce students to the foundational concepts and techniques of machine learning using Python. Each assignment is self-contained, allowing you to learn at your own pace.

## Assignments Included

1. **Linear Regression**: Implement simple and multiple linear regression models to predict continuous outcomes.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Learn how to classify data and predict binary outcomes using logistic regression.
3. **Decision Trees**: Understand decision trees for both classification and regression tasks.
4. **Random Forests**: Explore ensemble learning with random forests and improve model accuracy.
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Implement KNN for classification and regression tasks, understanding how proximity affects predictions.
6. **Clustering with K-Means**: Perform clustering analysis using the K-Means algorithm to group similar data points.
7. **Neural Networks**: Get started with neural networks using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for basic image classification tasks.
8. **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Learn to evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curves.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Onkar28/ML Assignments.git
    cd machine-learning-assignments
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Folder**: Each assignment is in its own folder, with a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file containing the tasks and explanations.

3. **Run the Assignments**: Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., JupyterLab, Google Colab) and follow the instructions provided in each notebook.

## Learning Objectives

By completing these assignments, you will:

- Gain a strong understanding of basic machine learning algorithms and their applications.
- Develop proficiency in using Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib for data analysis and model building.
- Learn to evaluate and improve machine learning models using various metrics and techniques.
- Build confidence in applying machine learning techniques to real-world datasets.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of these assignments, it is recommended that you have:

- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Understanding of fundamental statistics and linear algebra concepts.
- Familiarity with Jupyter Notebook or similar environments.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: Before running the assignments, install the necessary Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Start with Basics**: If you're new to machine learning, begin with the earlier assignments like Linear Regression and Logistic Regression before moving on to more advanced topics.
